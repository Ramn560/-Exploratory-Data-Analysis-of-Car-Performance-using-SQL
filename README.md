Our project focused on conducting a comprehensive data analysis of a car performance dataset using SQL. We employed various SQL techniques and functionalities to explore, analyze, and gain insights from the dataset. Beginning with data exploration, we used SQL queries with GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions to examine different aspects of the car models, including make, model, origin, specifications, and performance metrics. We utilized the HAVING clause to filter data based on specific conditions, such as identifying car manufacturers with at least three different models and car origins with an average MPG in the city higher than a threshold. Additionally, we leveraged window functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to perform calculations and break down complex queries. Throughout the project, we employed data visualization tools like Excel or Tableau to present our findings effectively, ensuring that the results are easily understandable for non-technical stakeholders. The project showcases the power of SQL in exploring and analyzing datasets, enabling valuable insights and data-driven decision-making in the automotive industry.
